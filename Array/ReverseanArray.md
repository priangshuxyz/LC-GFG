<p>[Naive Approach] Using a temporary array - O(n) Time and O(n) Space

The idea is to use a temporary array to store the reverse of the array.

Create a temporary array of same size as the original array. 

Now, copy all elements from original array to the temporary array in reverse order.

Finally, copy all the elements from temporary array back to the original array.</p>

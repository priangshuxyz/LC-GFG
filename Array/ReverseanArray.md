<p>[Naive Approach] Using a temporary array - O(n) Time and O(n) Space

The idea is to use a temporary array to store the reverse of the array.
<li>Create a temporary array of same size as the original array.</li>
<li>Now, copy all elements from original array to the temporary array in reverse order.
</li>
<li>Finally, copy all the elements from temporary array back to the original array.</li>
 </p>

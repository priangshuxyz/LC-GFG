<p>[Naive Approach] Using Nested Loop - O(n2) Time and O(1) Space
The idea is to check, for each day, how many consecutive previous days had stock prices less than or equal to the current dayâ€™s price. This can be done by moving leftwards from the current index until a higher price is found or the beginning of the array is reached.</p>

```cpp
    int n = arr.size(); 
    vector<int> span(n, 1);
    
    // Calculate span for each day
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        
        // Traverse left while the next element
        // on the left is smaller than arr[i]
        for (int j = i - 1; (j >= 0)
                      && (arr[i] >= arr[j]); j--) {
            span[i]++;
        }
    }

    return span;

<p>[Expected Approach] - By Reversing The Number
Time Complexity : O(d) , where d = log₁₀(n)
Auxiliary space: O(1)
The idea is to find the reverse of the original number and then compare the reversed number with the original number. If the reversed number is same as the original number, the number is palindrome. Otherwise, the number is not a palindrome.  </p>
